My Solution for Chapter 2 Exercise 6 of "Introduction to Programming Using Java"

Suppose that a file named “testdata.txt” contains the following information: The first (solution)
line of the file is the name of a student. Each of the next three lines contains an integer.
The integers are the student’s scores on three exams. Write a program that will read
the information in the file and display (on standard output) a message that contains the
name of the student and the student’s average grade on the three exams. The average is
obtained by adding up the individual exam grades and then dividing by the number of
exams.

Notes:
TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author
to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
